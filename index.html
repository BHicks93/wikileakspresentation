<p>Australian, now 43, lives in an office converted into a studio apartment in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, equipped with a bed, telephone, sun lamp, computer, shower, treadmill, and kitchenette. Police remain stationed outside the building to arrest him should he try to leave at a cost of 3.25 million pounds a year. Over 9,000 pounds per day (or $13,413).</p>

<p>Assange had a nomadic childhood, and lived in over thirty different towns by his mid-teens. Studied programming, mathematics, and physics but never completed a degree. At 16 he started hacking. He was really really good at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange#Hacking">hacking</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange#Programming">programming.</a> In his early days he hacked into the Pentagon and other U.S. Department of Defense facilities, the U.S. Navy, NASA, Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission; Citibank, Motorola, Panasonic, and Xerox to name a few.</p>

<p>At 35 he founded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks">Wikileaks</a> in Iceland with a few other activist. WikiLeaks publish many notable documents as noted <a href="#resources">below</a>. As  WikiLeaks grew in popularity as did it's editor-in-cheif. He became a public figure and with the fame came an increased scrutiny. The U.S. authorities began investigating WikiLeaks and Assange after Wikileaks released the <a href="#manning">Manning material</a>. The Swedish Prosecution Authority also is investigating Assange over sexual charges. He was granted political asylum by the Ecuadorian embassy. Last month, the Swedish prosecutors said they would be <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31867829">willing to interview Assange in the UK.</a> If he went to Sweden for a trial he would lose all his political immunity, leaving him subject to the US where he could face 40 years.

<p>As we <a href="http://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/anonymity_as_culture__treatise">read</a> this week, the internet and Scientology don't mix. Assange said that a religious organization was pretty inconsequential in terms of what we normally do. But after receiving these legal threats from them ... it was time for us to make a stand.</p>
